    "   Key Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR)\n",
    "\n",
    "For Simple Linear Regression to give accurate and reliable results, several important assumptions must be satisfied. These assumptions ensure that the estimated regression line truly represents the relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) must be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a change in X produces a proportional change in Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically,\n",
    "Y=a+bX+e should represent a straight-line relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Example: As study hours increase, exam marks increase roughly in a straight-line pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be no correlation between consecutive error terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important in time series data, where errors may be correlated over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Test: Durbin-Watson test is often used to check this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of residuals should be constant across all values of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the spread of residuals (errors) should remain the same for small and large values of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå Violation Example: If the spread of errors increases with X, it‚Äôs called heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (errors) should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption is especially important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Check: A histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals should show a roughly bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No (or Minimal) Measurement Error in Independent Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variable (X) should be measured accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in measuring X can lead to biased or misleading estimates of the slope (b).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. No Perfect Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption applies mainly to multiple regression, but in SLR, it means there should be only one independent variable, and it must not be a constant or have zero variance."
